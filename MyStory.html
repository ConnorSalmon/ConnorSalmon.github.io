									<p><strong>From the Berlin Startup Scene to CES 2019</strong></p>

								<p>I have gained a tremendous amount of experience during my four years working in the dynamic Berlin tech-scene, often jokingly refered to as "Silicon Allee." I worked on many different projects and obtained valuable leadership experiece, however most crucially I fell in love with <i>Design</i>. I discovered my passion for construction and my insatiable ability to question almost everthing was perfect UX career building material. You never work a day if you love what you do... I found that balance.</p>

.								<h1>Bosch</h1>

								<p></p>
								<p>Working at Bosch has been an amazing experiece. I was not only able to hone my UX skills, but I was also formally introduced to a whole new business sector(automotive/AV). IVS or In-Vehicle-Sensing was my laser-focus for the entirety of my internship. I was in charge of developing lean-personas, HiFi wireframes, and conducting demos of our test vehicle. Learning from the UX team at Bosch and seeing the level of their deliverables was of key importance to me. I really wanted to be able to juxtapose my level of degin to theirs. I got what I wanted and I have also grown so much as a designer during my time here in Sunnyvale.</p>

								<h1>Bier-Hier</h1>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p></p>
								<p>The Bier-Hier concept was fully crystalized a couple of years into my new Berlin life. I was fully immersed in the Berlin lifestyle and culture, Ich bin ein Berliner! I saw a need for the craftbeer to be more accessible at all hours of the day and night, no matter your location. Berlin is teeming with vibrant nightlife and has a 24hr beer scene due to the cornorstore or  "spati" culture, however craftbeer was not accessible at these late night establishments. Thus Bier-Hier was born! A craftbeer delivery service in the palm of your hand. </p>
