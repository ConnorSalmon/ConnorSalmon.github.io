									<h1>This is My Story</h1>
									<p><strong>From the Berlin Startup Scene to CES 2019</strong></p>

								<p>Berlin inspired me to challenge myself. I was enticed to run in the 2019 half-marathon as a way of saying "Auf Wiedersehen" to the life I happily lead there (I survived the race...yay pain!). However, more importantly, Berlin inspired me to challenge my myself professionally. I have gained a tremendous amount of experience during the past four years I worked within the dynamic Berlin tech-scene, often jokingly refered to as "Silicon Allee." I helped forge many different projects, wearing many different "hats" and obtained invaluable leadership experiece, although most crucially I fell in love with <i>Design</i>. I discovered my true passion for product development and my insatiable ability to question almost everthing in front of me was instrumental in crafting my UX career path.</p>

								<p></p>
								<p>Working at Bosch, Sunnyvale has quite simply been an amazing experiece. I was not only able to hone my UX skills, but I was also formally introduced to a whole new business sector (automotive/AV). IVS or In-Vehicle-Sensing was my laser-focus for the entirety of my internship. I was in charge of developing lean-personas, Hi-Fi wireframes, and conducting demos of our test vehicle. I had the opportunity to work on the visuals for Bosch's CES 2019 presentation of the IVS system and even contribute as an actor in the filmed presentation. Learning from the UX team here at Bosch and seeing the level of their deliverables was of key importance to me. I really wanted to be able to juxtapose my level of design with their expectations. I got what I wanted and I have grown so much as a designer because of it.</p>

								<h1>Bier-Hier</h1>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p></p>
								<p>The Bier-Hier concept was fully crystalized a couple of years into my new life in Berlin, as I was at this point fully immersed in the Berlin lifestyle and culture. Ich bin ein Berliner! I saw a dire need for craftbeer to become more mainstream. My friends and coworkers were all yearning for this fledgling industry to become more accesible to them outside of just the small breweries producing the beer. Berlin is teeming with vibrant nightlife and has a 24hr beer scene due to the corner-store or  "spati" culture, however craftbeer was not as easy to obtain as one might think. Thus Bier-Hier was born! A craftbeer delivery service in the palm of your hand! I designed the iOS app and wrote the overall business plan. As a founder I was also required to pitch the idea to investors and secure vital VC funding.</p>

								<p></p>
								<p>This beer-themed delivery status trcacker was one of my favorite screens due to its playful design and the fundamental user utility it provided. The beer image on the loading screen fills as the beverage order makes its way to the customer. Combining utility, brand and entertainment value was the goal.</p>
