									<h1>This is My Story</h1>
									<p><strong>From the Berlin Startup Scene to CES 2019</strong></p>

								<p></p>
								<p>I have gained a tremendous amount of experience during the four years I worked within the dynamic Berlin tech-scene, often jokingly refered to as "Silicon Allee." I helped forge many different projects, wearing many different "hats" and obtained invaluable leadership experiece, however most crucially I fell in love with <i>Design</i>. I discovered my true passion for construction and my insatiable ability to question almost everthing infront of me was instrumental in crafting my UX career path.</p>

.								<h1>Bosch</h1>

								<p></p>
								<p>Working at Bosch has quite simply been an amazing experiece. I was not only able to hone my UX skills, but I was also formally introduced to a whole new business sector(automotive/AV). IVS or In-Vehicle-Sensing was my laser-focus for the entirety of my internship. I was in charge of developing lean-personas, Hi-Fi wireframes, and conducting demos of our test vehicle. Learning from the UX team at Bosch and seeing the level of their deliverables was of key importance to me. I really wanted to be able to juxtapose my level of design with their expectations. I got what I wanted and I have also grown so much as a designer during my time here at Bosch, Sunnyvale.</p>

								<h1>Bier-Hier</h1>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p></p>
								<p>The Bier-Hier concept was fully crystalized a couple of years into my new life in Berlin. I was fully immersed in the Berlin lifestyle and culture, Ich bin ein Berliner! I saw a dire need for craftbeer to be more accessible to a wider population. My friends and coworkers were all yearning for this fledgling industry to become more accesible. Berlin is teeming with vibrant nightlife and has a 24hr beer scene due to the cornorstore or  "spati" culture, however craftbeer was not as easy to obtain as one might think. Thus Bier-Hier was born! A craftbeer delivery service in the palm of your hand! I designed the iOS app and wrote the overall business plan. As a founder I was also required to pitch the idea to investors and secure VC funding.</p>
